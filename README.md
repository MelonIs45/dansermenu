## How to Install the menu
1. Head over to the latest release page found [HERE](https://github.com/MelonIs45/dansermenu/releases/latest)
2. In the assets tab, click on the file called `DANSER-Menu-Va.b.c.zip`
3. Once downloaded, extract all the files
4. Now copy all these files into your danser folder. If you dont have danser already you can follow [THIS SETUP GUIDE](https://github.com/Wieku/danser-go/wiki/Setup-Guide) to get started! (only steps 1 and 2)
5. Run `DANSER Menu.exe`

## Known problems you might face
1. `To run this application, you must install .NET Core.`
* Simply download [THIS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.22-windows-x64-installer) and install it onto your system.
2. `danser.exe not found in the same directory as the program!`
* Make sure that all of your menu files are in the same folder as the main `danser.exe` file.
3. Thats all I can think of so far
